                <td>As a developer, you may thinking why partial compiled code or why not fully compiled code. The reason is very simple. We don’t know in what kind of environment .NET Code will run (for example, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 10, Windows Server, etc.). In other words, we don’t know what operating system is going to run our application; we also don’t know the CPU configuration, machine configuration, security configuration, etc. So, the IL code is partially compiled and at runtime, this IL code is compiled to machine-specific instructions using the environmental properties such as OS, CPU, Machine Configuration, etc.</td>
